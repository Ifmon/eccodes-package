## Description 📝
This project aims to simplify the installation of the "eccodes" library by generating .deb packages. The "eccodes" library, developed by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ☁️, provides a collection of tools and libraries for decoding and encoding meteorological data in the GRIB and BUFR formats. 🌤️

## Why Use .deb Packages? ⚙️
As ECMWF does not provide a package repository for "eccodes," users often have to compile and install the library manually, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. By generating .deb packages, this project facilitates the installation and maintenance of "eccodes" on Debian-based systems, allowing users to quickly install the library with the package manager. 📦

## How to Use the .deb Packages? 🛠️
The generated .deb packages can be installed using the dpkg command. Simply download the appropriate .deb package for your system architecture and run:

```sudo dpkg -i eccodes-<version>.deb```

Replace <version> with the actual version number of the package you downloaded. 🚀
